Q2: How would you design a Disaster Recovery (DR) plan for a mission-critical application?
Scenario: A financial services company needed a DR plan for their transaction processing system.
Solution:
•	Implemented a pilot light strategy in AWS:
o	Critical components (e.g., databases) were replicated to another region using AWS RDS Cross-Region Replication.
o	Minimal infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances) was pre-configured in the DR region but kept in a stopped state to reduce costs.
•	Automated failover using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch to detect failures and trigger the DR process.
•	Conducted regular DR drills to ensure the plan worked as expected.
Outcome: The company could recover from a regional outage within 30 minutes, ensuring minimal disruption to operations.
